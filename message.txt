Subject: A super secret test message.

This is a super secret message intended for only authorized individuals. Notice that with ECB
encryption the same plain text encrypts to the same cipher text. Thus the line of '=' at the
top of this message shows up as 12 identical blocks of cipher text. Furthermore an attacker
who knows something of the message may be able to predict the content of certain headers or
other fields. This gives the attacker a sample of plain text along with the corresponding ciper
text. Thus the attacker can mount a "known plain text attack" to find the key.
